* Web Desing, Course 1 (HTML), Week 2
** Document Object Model (DOM)
We call the structure of a web page the DOM. It's a tree-like
structure, which basically means that the =<html>= tag is at the top, and all other tags are inside of it (the video gives a nice graphic, at 1:03).

#+BEGIN_HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>content goes here</p>
  </body>
</html>
#+END_HTML 

There used to be a lot of =DOCTYPE=s, but HTML5 simplified it all down to one. =DOCTYPE= declaration say what kind of document this is. Nowadays, it's just HTML5, but there used to be stuff like =XHTML= and =DHTML=, and they all had their own versions.
